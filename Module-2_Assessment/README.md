This is a Hangman game I created which draws inspiration from the video game Animal Crossing.
All of the words relate to characters in the game. 
This project tested my application of booleans, strings, numbers, loops, conditionals, functions, objects, and event listeners. 
To play, guess 9 times in order to elucidate the name of the character. Have fun!
